Rush rally is an engaging mobile game made with unity. It is a vehichle/car game where players traverse through various terrains overcoming obstacles and collecting fuels. It is based on car and person physics, in other words it demostrates the perfect way how a car drives through a certain path and how much fuel is required while driving the kilometers and fuel is lost overtime while speeding slowing down or reversing. It also consists of race against time to spice up the game even more. It has immersive music and a number of vehichles to choose from.
